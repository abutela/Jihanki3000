# Jihanki3000
A fun(?) and educational(?) interactive vending machine

# What's a 'jihanki'?
A jihanki is a common term for vending machines in Japan, a portmanteau of "jidou" (automatic) + "hanbai" (selling) + "ki" (machine).

# ... You couldn't have just made a normal vending machine?
Well, they're normal in Japan.  Given 5 years living there, their prevalence, and their general ability to not eat your money, I actually have more experience using them than typical American vending machines.

# So what does it do?
It vends! More specifically, it uses arrays, stacks, and plain old integers to determine if you've inserted money, whether there's enough for your selection, and if there's stock of your chosen item.  

First, take whatever coins you have in your wallet* into your hand (click the coin, and it will be added to "Coins in Hand"). Click the coin slot for a pleasing clink sound, and the machine tallies up what you've inserted.
If all goes well you can click a button to "buy" a drink, and it plays a fun THUNK sound and displays your item in the bay.  If there's still money in the machine, click the return coin lever to get the coins safely back in your wallet.

# What's that asterisk for?
You might start the program with 0 coins in your wallet! Until further notice, just click the "x00" next to a coin to get one.

# What's the general purpose for this to exist?
My teacher once said that building a vending machine was a good programming exercise... so here we are.

My hope is that by building something I know, that isn't neccesarily well known, I can both 1) get experience coding such a thing as well as 2) create a fun little thing that can also passively teach how to use a Japanese vending machine, what the value of each coin is, yadda yadda yadda, without ever having to sit down and say "ok, so this is a 10 yen coin..."

# Cool! What's next?

This doesn't really have a trajectory yet. Maybe it could be incorporated in a Japanese-specific language teaching game, or any game that uses points for rewards. Could possibly be a standalone "stuff of the world" clicakamajig and maybe create some other machines to go with it. Who knows!
